# Speed-Detection-and-Plate-Recognition

## Introduction
India’s road safety is the worst on record. Around 149,000 people lost their lives on Indian roads in 2018 alone. India accounts for about 2% of motor vehicles globally, yet it’s responsible for more than 11% of road traffic deaths.
With our police forces being understaffed it is very important to look towards a new solution. We have made an easy to implement solution in which we are harnessing the power of computer vision to detect objects (car and number plates). Then we are calculating the speeds of the car. Those cars with speed greater than a certain limit will get captured and license plate is extracted from the image of the car. Later a CNN based model is used to predict the characters of the license plate.
